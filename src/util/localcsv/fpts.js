  '<q>fp-ts aims to allow developers to use popular patterns and abstractions that ' +
  'are available in most functional languages. ' +
  'For this, it includes the most popular data types, type classes and abstractions such as ' +
  'Option, Either, IO, Task, Functor, Applicative, Monad to empower users to write pure FP apps ' +
  'and libraries built atop higher order abstractions.</q></p><br/>' +
